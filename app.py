        **Flash Rank**: Ultra-lite & Super-fast Python library for search & retrieval re-ranking.

        - **Ultra-lite**: No heavy dependencies. Runs on CPU with a tiny ~4MB reranking model.
        - **Super-fast**: Speed depends on the number of tokens in passages and query, plus model depth.
        - **Cost-efficient**: Ideal for serverless deployments with low memory and time requirements.
        - **Based on State-of-the-Art Cross-encoders**: Includes models like ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2 (default), ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2, rank-T5-flan, and ms-marco-MultiBERT-L-12.
        - **Sleek Models for Efficiency**: Designed for minimal overhead in user-facing scenarios.

        _Flash Rank is tailored for scenarios requiring efficient and effective reranking, balancing performance with resource usage._
